/**
 * <h3>The {@code operationservice} package</h3>
 * This is one of the core part of the CVFS application. It encapsulates the users commands into {@code Operation} objects, along with the aplication state ({@code State} objects), to ensure the executions. Specifically, a {@code OperationFactory} class is used to encapsulate operations, while an {@code OperationRecord} class assists the Controller in managing executed operations and handling undo and redo features.
