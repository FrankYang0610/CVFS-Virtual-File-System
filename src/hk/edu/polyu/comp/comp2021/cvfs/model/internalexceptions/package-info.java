/**
 * <h3>The {@code model.internalexceptions} Package</h3>
 * This package lists all possible exceptions that may occur in the Model part. These exceptions should be managed exclusively by the file system. However, due to incomplete simulation, some entities may also use these exceptions.
 * <p>
 * These exceptions are used internally by the Model part, and only the {@code ModelException} is exposed to the other parts.
